## Design

The Helm charters available are developed with the aim of providing a quick and easy way to deploy a production-ready instance of the Znuny application using the **docker-znuny** container image.

## Features

They currently only manage the deployment of the Znuny application, as well as the Kubernetes ecosystem required for a high-performance, robust production environment.

Helm charters manage the following resources:

* ServiceAccount
* ConfigMap
* PersistentVolumeClaims
* Deployment
* HorizontalPodScaling
* Service
* Ingress
